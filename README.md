# Ontology model for qualitative description of quantitative information

This project is based on the Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO), and
aims to formally define and constrain the classes in the CMO using
classes from anatomy, quality, and chemical structure ontologies. The
goal is to formally integrate the CMO (which contains largely
quantitative traits) with phenotype ontologies that qualitatively
describe phenotypes.

We lexically decompose the CMO, and use axiom patterns to constrain
the classes in the CMO.
